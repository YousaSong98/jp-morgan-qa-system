Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bassist Mark Evans. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's Powerage. In February 1980, about seven months after the release of their breakthrough album Highway to Hell, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking.[4] The group considered disbanding but elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement.[5] Later that year, the band released their first album with Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became one of the best selling albums of all time.\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"64804dfb","metadata":{"id":"64804dfb"},"outputs":[],"source":["question = \"where AC/DC is from?\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4bb1e5ec","metadata":{"id":"4bb1e5ec","outputId":"439a7525-6292-40fd-9ca6-57a178956792"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{'score': 0.005645206198096275, 'start': 33, 'end': 68, 'answer': \", 2016 at Levi's Stadium in the San\"}\n"]}],"source":["from transformers import pipeline\n","qa_pipeline = pipeline(\n","    \"question-answering\",\n","    model= model,\n","    tokenizer= tokenizer\n",")\n","\n","predictions = qa_pipeline({\n","    'context': context,\n","    'question': \"What day was the game played on?\"\n","})\n","\n","print(predictions)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"774e01d0","metadata":{"id":"774e01d0"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"colab":{"name":"test_fine_tuned_v1_SQUAD.ipynb","provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
